<p>Just came over the amazing article <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code</a> written way back in 2000, but it's still 100% true! </p>  <p>Actually IMHO we could improve the article slightly (today after more than 10 years since original article was published)</p>  <ul>   <li>It’s worth to add there something like – “<em>Do you use any Test First Development technique?</em>”</li>    <li>Also “<em>Do you have a spec?”</em> could become something like “Do you use Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)?”</li> </ul>  <p>Interesting thing is that I read that article several years ago and it was very fun to read it now to compare my perception.</p>
