<p>Yesterday I took a look at the interesting research - <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=81068">Notifications and Awareness: A Field Study of Alert Usage and Preferences</a>. </p>  <p>The aim was to discover the influence of the desktop (Email) notifications on the productivity.</p>  <p>As I undestood the conclusion is that users are able to determine if an notification is urgent and needs an immediate response.</p>  <p>So if user is working on an ongoing task which requires full concentration, in most cases he\she will decide to put notification aside and will continue his\her work.</p>
