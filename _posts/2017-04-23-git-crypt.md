Here at [Compellotech](http://www.compellotech.com) we are using [Octopus](https://octopus.com/) to automate all of our deployments for several years now.
Recently we started to accommodate [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Infrastructure_as_Code) (IAC) approach to simplify environments management. It allows us to spin new environments right from Octopus dashboard.

We are using **Azure Key Vault** to store secret data (such as SSL Certificates).

And I just came across an interesting alternative [git-crypt](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/). It looks very convenient.

> git-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository. Files which you choose to protect are encrypted when committed, and decrypted when checked out.
