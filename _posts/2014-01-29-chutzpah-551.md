I was helping my peer developer to setup TFS Build to run Jasmine tests. 
Thanks to Visual Studio & TFS teams it's really easy to do since TFS 2012! (I configured TFS Build to run Machine.Specification couple of years ago)
We were using the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2012/07/09/javascript-unit-tests-on-team-foundation-service-with-chutzpah.aspx">Javascript Unit Tests on Team Foundation Service with Chutzpah</a> guide.

It's very nice and straightforward article. 
The only thing I don't like about it is that it needs to set <em>Copy to Output Directory</em> on each test file.
Instead of that we added the following Post-build script, so we don't need to set <em>Copy to Output Directory</em> on each test file. 


<blockquote>for /R $(ProjectDir) %%G IN (*.test.js) DO copy "%%G" $(TargetDir)</blockquote>



Hope it helps!
