We were planning to port our application into Mono to give it a try on a Raspberry Pi for a quite a while.
What's interesting now, then we finally started to do this, <a href="http://alexrp.com/">Alex RÃ¸nne Petersen</a> added a <a href="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=7938#c16">hard float support</a> to Mono!
I was able to build his <a href="https://github.com/alexrp/mono/tree/armhf">armhf</a> branch directly on my Raspberry Pi.
So now I'm all set to port our application!

Thanks to Alex! Thanks to the Mono team! :)
