<p>I planned to get familiar with some of the schemaless databases for a long time. And eventually got time to this a couple of days ago. And it was real surprise for me to see post on this topic on the <a href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowlerâ€™s blog</a> <em>next day</em> since I blogged about my first <a href="http://ayvazyan.net/2013/01/mongodb-at-a-glance/">MongoDB experience</a>.</p>  <p>Anyway I highly recommend you to review this great <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless/">Schemaless Data Structures</a> presentation.</p>
