<p>Finally got some time to watch Phil Haack’s talk <a href="http://vimeo.com/43612883">Git and GitHub for Developers on Windows</a>. It was really interesting. </p>  <p><a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> has really nice clean UI. Fun thing is that recently we used the same model to deliver our software as GitHub folks did – use ClickOnce as a deployment technique. Although we went a little further with it. Our installer doesn’t show any standard ClickOnce windows, it just uses API to streamline installation process. Also we build personal installer for each user who gets invitation or license, cause each copy could be installed just once.</p>
