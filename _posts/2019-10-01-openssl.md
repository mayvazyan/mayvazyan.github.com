We needed to issue a tiny patch release for one of our legacy applications. To do so we had to order a new code-signing certificate.
I was a bit surprised then build failed with **Invalid provider type specified** error. For the some reason it was failing to sign **Click Once** manifest. What's interesting **signtool.exe** was able to use that certificate just fine…
I was lucky enough to find amazing blog post at https://remyblok.tweakblogs.net/blog/11803/converting-certificate-to-use-csp-storage-provider-in-stead-of-cng-storage-provider
I faced an issue thought… I was not able to find **pvk.exe**, the author's website (at http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk/pvk.html) was down and I found no mirrors out there… 

So I found a bit different approach to tackle it:
 
1. I used OpenSSL to generate PVK out of PEM using the command below
`openssl rsa -inform PEM -outform PVK -in demo.pem -out demo.pvk -passin pass:secret -passout pass:secret`
2. Then I used OpenSSL to generate PFX out of PVK & CER files (I had to export public key as Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) at first for below command to work properly)
`openssl pkcs12 -export -out converted.pfx -inkey demo.pvk -in demo.cer -passin pass:secret -passout pass:secret`
