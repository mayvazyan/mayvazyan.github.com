GhostDoc is an amazing tool for everyone who is using Microsoft Visual Studio. I think what it's a "must have" extension.

GhostDoc helps to create xml comments for you code. Just press a hot key and GhostDoc will generate xml comments for you. In some cases you will need to make minor changes to generated comments. But very often generated comments very good, so you can continue to write code instead of comments ;)

Please review screenshot below and you will see it in action!
