<p>Just read interesting research <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/itanalyst/docs/05-05-10AgileDevelopmentManagementTools.PDF">The Forrester Waveâ„¢: Agile Development Management Tools, Q2 2010</a></p>  <p>I was a little surprised that TDD, BDD, FDD are the separate Agile methodologies. Previously I was totally sure that things such as TDD &amp; BDD are just a way to <em>Improve</em> an (any?) methodology!</p>
