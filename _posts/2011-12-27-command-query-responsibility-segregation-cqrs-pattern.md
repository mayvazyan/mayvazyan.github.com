<p>I've just read excellent <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">introduction to the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</a> pattern. And you know it seems really worthy to have in a toolbox.    <br />Actually just to be ready to use it I'll need to research many related patterns such as <em>Reporting Database</em>, <em>Event Sourcing</em>, etc..    <br />So check it yourself - read this great <em>CQRS</em> introduction to see how many useful patterns and practices those are related to <em>CQRS</em> you donâ€™t know yet <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://ayvazyan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png" /></p>
