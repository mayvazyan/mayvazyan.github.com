Hey there! My name is Michael Ayvazyan. 

I'm a Software Architect who works at [Vayner Systems](http://vaynersystems.com) to help customers to build creative software solutions with real business impact.

I'm really passionate about technology and love my family. Trying to stay fit and make some [music](https://soundcloud.com/michael-ayvazyan/tracks).

### Open Source
Way back in 2009 I created a tiny open source Database Access library <a title="Ndb Library" href="https://github.com/mayvazyan/ndb/">Ndb Library</a>. It was developed with Test First Development approach in mind and it implements code-centric approach to work with databases. I don't work on it anymore since Entity Framework team shipped <strong>EF Code First</strong> as a part of the Entity Framework 4 release. Ndb Library was designed to work with different database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SqLite, MSSQL Server were supported and it was not hard to add other enginses).

There is another small open source project <a href="https://github.com/mayvazyan/MSBuild.Scaffolding#msbuildscaffolding">MSBuild.Scaffolding</a>Â I published on Dec 8 2012. It allows to prepare solution for CI build (msbuild) using single `Enable-Versioning` command.
