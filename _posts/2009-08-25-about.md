Hey there! My name is Michael Ayvazyan. 

I'm an Architect who works at [Vayner Systems](http://vaynersystems.com) to help customers build creative software solutions with real business impact.

Way back in 2009 I create a tiny open source Database Access library <a title="Ndb Library" href="http://ndb.codeplex.com/">Ndb Library</a>. It was developed in Test First Development in mind and it implements code-centric approach to work with Database. I don't work on it anymore since Entity Framework team shipped <strong>EF Code First</strong> as a part of the Entity Framework 4 release. Ndb Library was designed to work with different database engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SqLite, MSSQL Server are supported). In the same time it's pretty easy to add other engines.

There is another small open source project <a href="https://github.com/mayvazyan/MSBuild.Scaffolding#msbuildscaffolding">MSBuild.Scaffolding</a>Â I published on Dec 8 2012. It allows to prepare solution for CI build (msbuild) using single <strong>Enable-Versioning</strong> command.


Also I love making music! Check it out at [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/michael-ayvazyan/sny)
