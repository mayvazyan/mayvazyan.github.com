First step in build script creation is always adding plumbing stuff. For example here's my typical workflow:
<ul>
	<li>Create Build folder on the solution level</li>
	<li>Create basic {SolutionName}.proj msbuild file by copying common targets from another project.</li>
	<li>Add <a href="https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks">MSBuild Community Tasks</a></li>
	<li>Update projects to use SharedAssemblyInfo.cs, so they will have correct version number.</li>
</ul>
And only after all above steps were completed we can start to work on the build script logic.
