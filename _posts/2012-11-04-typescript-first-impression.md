Finally got some time to watch Anders Hejlsberg's <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript">Introducing TypeScript</a>.
And you know TypeScript is just great.
I started my career as a PHP developer and soon I moved to .NET cause I just needed that strong typing :) You know it's a question of comfort.
<ul>
	<li>If you have a compiler that could help you to early discover issues with your code, it's much better then to discover them at run time.</li>
	<li>Also you can easily refactor your solution.</li>
</ul>
So what Anders Hejlsberg and his team did? They broughtÂ comfort to the JavaScript developers.
