<p>Just finished reading of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MongoDB-Definitive-Guide-Kristina-Chodorow/dp/1449381561">MongoDB: The Definitive Guide</a> book. You know it was really exciting. </p>  <p>The book is a great introduction to the MongoDB and to the all itâ€™s features. Also there are several nice examples those emphasize the advantages of the document-oriented databases. </p>  <p>As for the MongoDB itself, I hope to try it on one of the upcoming projects, cause I suppose document-oriented model will work just great for it.</p>
