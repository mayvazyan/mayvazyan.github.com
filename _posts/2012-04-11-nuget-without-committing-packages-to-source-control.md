<p>Several days ago switched to new approaching of working with NuGet by enabling <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/workflows/using-nuget-without-committing-packages#Using_NuGet_without_committing_packages_to_source_control">NuGet Package Restore</a> featrure. From now packages arenâ€™t being stored into source control. Instead NuGet download missing packages during build.</p>  <p>So far so good.</p>
